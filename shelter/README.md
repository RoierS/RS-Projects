# Shelter (RS School)

The Shelter Project is responsive website for a pet shelter. It provides information about various animals available for adoption. Users can explore different animal profiles, read their descriptions, and find out more about the shelter.

This project was created using a [Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/Yk6EnbY63FyG2PJTFkJDMh/shelter) as the basis for design, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation.

## Key Features
1. **Burger Menu:** The website includes a burger menu on both pages, enhancing navigation.

2. **Pop-up Windows:** Users can click on animal cards to view detailed pop-up windows with information about each animal. These pop-ups offer a closer look at each pet's details.

3. **Infinite Slider Carousel:** The "main" page features an infinite slider carousel, allowing users to view a selection of pets. It automatically slides between pet profiles for a dynamic viewing experience.

4. **Pagination:** The "pets" page includes pagination for easier navigation through a list of available pets.

5. **PerfectPixel:** The PerfectPixel extension was used to compare the implemented design with the original Figma layout for accuracy.
