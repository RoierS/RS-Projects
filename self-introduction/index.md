**Self-introduction text:**

&emsp;Hi everyone, My name is Roman, I'm from Warsaw, and this is my first video on YouTube. I want to tell you about myself and how I got into programming and RS School. 

&emsp;I'll start with the fact that I was born in a small town in the Ukrainian Donbass region, in a family of teachers. I graduated from Donetsk Trade and Economic University. Later, I entered a graduate school and wrote a research paper. I successfully passed the candidate exam in English and in my field of study. 

&emsp;But due to the well-known events, my family and I were forced to leave Donetsk and move to Berdychiv, another small town in Ukraine, to start everything anew.  

&emsp;There, I acquired new skills and mastered the profession of a sales manager. This experience played a significant role in improving my soft skills.

&emsp;Time passed, and we decided to move to Poland. Despite my lack of programming knowledge, I took up work as an international truck driver, even though I didn't know Polish and had no prior experience. My family's future was more important than any obstacles.

&emsp;As truck driver I transported sea containers between European ports and clients, visiting major ports like Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg, and Bremerhaven. I worked in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. English proficiency aided me in passing port tests and handling challenging situations with clients.

&emsp;During my work, I gradually learned Polish and successfully passed the state language exam at level B1. At the same time, I improved my English.

&emsp;My motivation is simple: my daughter. She initially motivated me. Being a driver kept me away from home for around four weeks. I had to change that to be present for my daughter daily - taking her to school, celebrating every holiday (including her birthday), and supporting her in sickness, happiness, and tears. This daily motivation drives me.

&emsp;And now, it's time to change everything once again...

&emsp;That's when I started self-studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned from publicly available materials on the internet and then came across RS School. I completed Stage 0, and now I'm at the end of Stage 1.

&emsp;When I first truly dived into JS, I realized that it was my passion, something I really enjoyed. You know, when you listen to a song for the first time, you immediately understand that it's going to be great, and from the first few seconds, you get goosebumps. When I wrote my first simple script and saw it working, I had that same feeling - goosebumps. So, I can say that this is my thing!

&emsp;As for my plans, I can say the following: first and foremost, I want to change my profession and become a front-end developer. But I don't think I'm limited to learning the backend or anything else. What I love about programming is the constant growth and development it offers.

&emsp;Regarding projects, currently, all my projects are educational and primarily focused on RS School. They greatly contribute to my development as a programmer. Some notable ones include Minesweeper, Shelter, Momentum, HTML Builder, and Virtual Keyboard. I want to highlight Minesweeper, as my daughter tested it and she really enjoyed it.

&emsp;All of this is just the beginning. I have a new path ahead of me, which I will undoubtedly walk.

&emsp;Thanks to RS School and all the viewers for watching this video.
